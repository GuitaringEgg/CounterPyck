# Thoughts


 Known limitations
 --------------
- Won't support resolutions other than 1920x1080. Should be easy to alter
- The code is a mess. The repo is a mess. Needs tidied before continueing
- Needs to be focused on the dota window atm, which isn't ideal. screenshoting the entire screen maybe take too long to analyse. Resize?
- Prelimanry matchup analysis is odd. Many negitive advantages. Need to consider the data more.
